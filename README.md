My name is Jongwon Shinn, from South Korea.

I had Technology Sales Representative experience at Oracle for 3 years. I don't have developing related technical experience but had chances to be account managers for customers. I joined MCDA program to change my career to more technical role.

I'm fresher to most of the contents we will learn in this class, thus I will do my best to catch up.
I'm looking forward to studying and working on projects :)
